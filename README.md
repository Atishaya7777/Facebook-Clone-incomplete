# Facebook clone wannabe

This was a fun little project I did in my spare time.

I tried cloning the previous Facebook versions, which unfortunately did not work out well.

For frontend, I used React.js. For the backend, I used really small snippet of JavaScript to host the server and give the usual post and get methods.

I put it as public as I wanted the viewers to have fun with it.
